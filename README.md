## About

K-bus/I-bus to Bluetooth bridge for Mini/BMWs. Based on ESP32.

### Hardware

See [hardware](hardware/README) folder

### Software

* [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)
* [btstack](https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Clone, build, and flash.

### Prerequisites

Install `esp-idf` and the ESP32 `btstack` port by following the respective instructions.

### Building

#### Hardware

**TBD**

#### Software

* Clone this repo and its submodules `git clone --recursive https://github.com/jmederos/esp32-r50-kbus.git`
* After installing prequisites, run the helper script `./tools/build.sh` to compile
* `./tools/flash_monitor.sh` to load onto ESP32 and run `idf.py monitor`
_Note: Helper scripts in tools folder assume a WSL Ubuntu install w/ESP32 on Windows COM4_

### Installing

* Use OEM CD changer pre-wiring in R50 behind right side panel in trunk.

#### R50 Support Docs
* [How to find pre-wiring](https://www.northamericanmotoring.com/forums/navigation-and-audio/224408-can-t-find-cd-changer-pre-wiring.html)

## Roadmap
| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Software POC: control phone via AVRCP w/o A2DP advertised. | üëåüèΩ | _Although part of the BT spec, example implementations on AVRCP-only are hard to come by._ |
| Hardware POC: acquire + test k-line transceivers. | üôåüèΩ |   |
| K-bus proof concept, pickup MFL messages. | üëçüèΩ | _Works in vehicle, works in mockup w/Navcoder + iPhone streaming to a BT headphone amp._ |
| Write to radio head unit display | ü•≥ | _Seems to work, now let's do scrolling display_ |
| SDRS Emulation | üëçüèΩ | _Functional, didn't really like the fact that FiiO BT amp didn't shutdown with car; will stick to aux input + `TEL` display updates for now._ |
| Write to radio head unit display | ü•≥ | _Seems to work, now let's do scrolling display_ |
| [AMS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleMediaService_Reference/Specification/Specification.html) instead of AVRCP |   | _Didn't know this was a thing, seems like a better bet; btstack + esp-idf is a little clunky._ |
| [ANCS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/Introduction/Introduction.html) Support & update radio display w/push notification | ü§û |   |

_See the [open issues](https://github.com/jmederos/esp32-r50-kbus/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues)._
